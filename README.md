# Gauges

A Pebble watchface that displays time on two separate analogue gauges.
Supports 12/24 hour modes, with appropriately-scaled gauges for each set
of hours.

## Bugs

Right now, the only problem I'm aware of is that the 12 hour face renders
midday and midnight at the 0 position instead of the 12. Not sure if
bug or feature.

## TODO

Animated needle transitions.
